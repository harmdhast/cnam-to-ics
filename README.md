This Node script scrapes CNAM's Moodle based calendar, converts it to iCal format, serves the .ics and also update those events in a specified Discord.
The script uses puppeteer to get all events reliably as the request parameters are generated by ASPNET applets and I cba to understand how it does.
Still need to make things optional, cleanup the code and convert it properly into multiple modules.

# USAGE

1. Rename `config.json.exemple` to `config.json`.
2. In `config.json` fill in the planning URL : You can find said URL by loading the page with the "Network" tab of the DevTools.
3. (Optional?) Fill in your Discord Application Token 
4. `node .\index.mjs`
